# 🛠️ Three.js Boilerplate 

## 🤷 What is this?

Just some light weight boilerplate for getting started with Three.js. This setup uses:
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (obviously).
- [Parcel](https://v2.parceljs.org/) for bundling.

## 📖 Commands

To build and watch for local dev (this will also open your default browser):

`npm run serve`

To build for production:

`npm run build`
